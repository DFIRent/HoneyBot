# HoneyBot
Discord Honey (P)(B)ot 

A super simple (for now maybe) program that I created when I had an idea for a discord honeypot bot

There are people always trying to invite public bots that are usually made by smaller devs/communities to try and take advantage of some overlooked permission check or function and use it for either trolling or actual malicious purposes.

So I had a quick idea to just make a bot whose entire purpose is to just log what people are trying to do to it while spitting out some fake error messages to keep them trying.

I feel like this can probably be improved and elaborated on much more but this is just the concept showcase for now.
